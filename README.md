# Videotop

## Description
A free console browser for online videos, written in python with vim-like keybindings.

## Usage
If you are already familiar with vim the controls should be pretty intuitive.  
There are two modes: command mode and browse mode.

In command mode you can search for videos by typing **:s** *VIDEOSEARCH* and hitting **ENTER**.  
This will generate a list of videos and switch to browse mode.

In browse mode you can download the videos by hitting **ENTER** and play them with **p**.
To abort the download of a video select it and hit **a**. Note that this won't delete the partially downloaded file,
in fact you can resume the download if you hit **ENTER** again.  
You can also open the YouTube page by hitting **o** or directly stream the video with MPlayer by hitting **s**.  
**CTRL n** lists the next videos of your previous search and **CTRL r** clears the screen.

To search for the string *SOMETHING* in the current video list type **/***SOMETHING* and
hit **n** to get to the next or **N** to get to the previous item.  
With the command **:videos** or just **:v** all downloaded videos will be listed. A pattern can also be specified, so
**:v monty** will list all videos containing the substring *monty*.
Since local searches are case-insensitive, the commands **:v monty** and **:v Monty** (or **/monty** and **/MONTY**) are
equivalent.  
Downloaded videos can be deleted with the command **:delete**. (*WARNING*: no undo)

All downloaded videos are stored in *~/.videotop/videos*.

## Configuration
For streaming you might want to add something like this in your MPlayer config (~/.mplayer/config), 
the values depend on your internet connection:

    [default]
    cache = 8192 # 8 mb cache
    cache-min = 5 # play if 5% of the cache is loaded in memory
